Matrices made by Arnau from openMC simulations.
- The decay matrix is triangularisable, and is simlar to the endfb71 matrix provided by Jiri. It contains some values with
    absolute value smaller than 1e-200 that should be set to zero.
- The burnup matrix is not triangularisable, and could in principle have complex eigenvalues. It was generated by burning a
    pincell of UO2 from 0 to 5 MWd/kgU during 365 days.
- The nuclide dictionary contains the list of nuclides corresponding to each column of the matrices.
- The dt_and_n0 file contains the initial concentration and the timestep of 365 days that was used in the openmc simulations.
    But in principle any n0 and dt could be used.
